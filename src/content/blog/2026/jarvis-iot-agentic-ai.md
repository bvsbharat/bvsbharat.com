Building a system where AI doesn't just respond — it acts. An AI agent that understands context, makes decisions, and controls connected devices just like JARVIS would.

That 10-year-old version of me who watched Iron Man and dreamed of having JARVIS just became reality.

## The Vision

Imagine an AI system that:
- Understands your environment and context
- Makes intelligent decisions based on multiple factors
- Controls your smart home, IoT devices, and systems seamlessly
- Learns from your patterns and adapts over time

No more fragmented apps. No more clicking through interfaces. Just natural language commands that actually *do* things.

## The Stack

**Core Technologies:**
- **AI/LLM** — Large language models for natural language understanding and decision-making
- **Agent Framework** — Agentic AI orchestration to handle complex workflows
- **IoT Integration** — Direct control over smart home devices and connected systems
- **Speech Recognition & NLP** — Open-source components to make this accessible to everyone

## The Magic

The magic happens when the AI agent doesn't just respond — it acts. It understands context, makes decisions, and controls connected devices just like JARVIS would.

And the best part? I'm open-sourcing the entire project because childhood dreams should be shared, not gatekept.

## The Journey

That 10-year-old version of me would've absolutely lost it seeing this work.

This wasn't just about building a project — it was about proving that childhood tech dreams are worth pursuing. That the things we dreamed about watching sci-fi movies can actually become reality with enough passion and code.

Your turn — what's the childhood tech dream you're ready to build?
