Thrilled to share that my team emerged as **winners at the Deloitte Megathon**, where we were challenged to create revolutionary apps in categories like mobile, AR, AI, and Progressive Web Apps. We chose to build a transformative social platform for Deloitte's global community.

## Project: Donateit

**Purpose**: Facilitates a robust connection within the Deloitte community, enabling employees to donate to or request items for underprivileged students and needy individuals in their local areas.

### Features

- **Community Engagement**: Users can post requests for needed items or services, allowing others within the organization to respond directly with donations
- **Resource Sharing**: Provides a platform for Deloitte employees to offer pre-owned goods, ensuring resources are utilized effectively and sustainably
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed as a Progressive Web App to ensure accessibility across all devices, with seamless performance and offline capabilities

## Why It Mattered

This app not only enhances community engagement within Deloitte but also fosters a **culture of giving and support**, extending the firm's impact beyond business and into direct community aid.

The hackathon categories included mobile, AR, AI, and PWA — we chose PWA because we believed in making the platform accessible to everyone, regardless of device or connectivity. The offline-first approach meant that employees in any location could participate in the donation ecosystem.

## Tech Stack

- **Progressive Web App** — Service workers, caches, push notifications
- **Responsive Design** — Works across all devices
- **Offline-First** — Full functionality without internet connection
- **Location-Based** — Connects donors with recipients in their local area

This achievement is a testament to our team's dedication to creating solutions that make a real difference, leveraging technology to build stronger, more supportive environments.
