My team secured **first place** at the Kantar Big Data Hackathon, where we leveraged extensive GPS data from 20 different users to derive actionable business insights. Our challenge involved analyzing continuous tracking data to understand consumer behaviors and preferences within a specific urban landscape.

## What We Built

### Data Mapping
Developed an innovative solution to **map all user movements on Google Maps**, identifying key patterns in daily routines and frequent locations.

### Behavioral Insights
Extracted lifestyle habits by analyzing locations frequented by users — restaurants, gyms, shopping centers, commute patterns, and more.

### Strategic Recommendations
Utilized the compiled data to deliver a comprehensive **market research report**, pinpointing:

- The most popular eateries and dining patterns
- Preferred fitness centers and workout schedules
- Shopping habits and retail preferences
- Commute patterns and transportation choices
- Weekend vs. weekday behavioral differences

## Impact

The insights gained from this analysis not only showcased the potential of GPS data in understanding consumer behavior but also provided local businesses with valuable recommendations on **where to focus their marketing efforts** for maximum impact.

## What I Learned

This experience enhanced my skills in:

- **Data Visualization** — Turning raw GPS coordinates into meaningful visual stories
- **Pattern Recognition** — Identifying behavioral trends across diverse user groups
- **Strategic Analysis** — Translating data insights into actionable business recommendations
- **Google Maps API** — Working with geolocation data at scale

## Looking Back

This was my first hackathon win, back in 2014 at Kantar. It planted the seed for my data-driven approach to problem-solving that continues today. The experience of taking raw, messy GPS data and turning it into actionable insights was transformative — it showed me the power of data to tell stories about human behavior.

From big data analytics in 2014 to agentic AI in 2024, the thread has always been the same: using technology to understand and serve people better.
