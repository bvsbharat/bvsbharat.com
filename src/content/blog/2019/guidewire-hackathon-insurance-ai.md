We secured the **Runner-Up** position at the Guidewire Software hackathon focused on innovating the insurance sector!

## The Challenge

Insurance adjusters manually note information during calls with policyholders — a slow and error-prone process. We set out to revolutionize how adjusters handle data during these critical calls.

## Our Solution

A powerful AI assistant that integrates with the Guidewire web app, available as both a **Chrome extension** and a **smart agent**.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Transcription**: Captures every word during calls with policyholders
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Uses Google NLP to extract and process key information automatically
- **Efficient Workflow**: Automatically fills in claim forms, saving time and reducing errors
- **Dual Interface**: Available as both a Chrome extension and standalone smart agent

## Impact

Previously, adjusters manually noted information — a slow and error-prone process. Our assistant streamlines this entire workflow:

- **Faster claims handling**: Automated transcription eliminates manual note-taking
- **Reduced errors**: NLP extraction ensures accurate data capture
- **More focus time**: Frees adjusters to focus on critical tasks rather than data entry

## Looking Forward

This hackathon was a pivotal moment — it showed me how AI could transform traditional enterprise workflows. The experience of building an AI-powered tool for real insurance workflows laid the groundwork for my current work leading AI initiatives at Guidewire, where we've since deployed multi-agent systems serving 50K+ daily users.

Thank you to everyone who supported us, and congrats to all participants! Together, we are building the future of insurance.
