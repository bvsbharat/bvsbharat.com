This was the first time I hacked in the financial domain. It was good learning and a great experience. Hackathon #32!

## What We Built

**ClaimsPilot AI** — an intelligent claims processing system that automates claim intake, triage, and routing with real-time visibility and evidence links. The platform streamlines the entire claims workflow from submission to resolution.

### Key Features

- **Automated Claim Intake** — AI-powered form processing that extracts key information from claim submissions automatically
- **Intelligent Triage** — Classifies and prioritizes claims based on severity, type, and complexity using machine learning
- **Smart Routing** — Automatically routes claims to the appropriate handlers based on expertise and workload
- **Real-Time Visibility** — Dashboard providing live status updates and progress tracking across all claims
- **Evidence Links** — Automated collection and linking of supporting evidence to each claim

## The LandingAI x Pathway Experience

The **Hack With Bay** hackathon, organized by LandingAI and Pathway in collaboration with Silicon Valley AI Hub (SVAI), brought together developers to tackle real-world problems in the financial domain. The challenge pushed us to think about how AI can transform traditional, paper-heavy insurance and claims workflows.

Working with LandingAI's computer vision capabilities and Pathway's real-time data processing framework gave us a powerful toolkit for building an end-to-end claims automation system.

## Why It Matters

Claims processing is one of the most labor-intensive workflows in insurance and financial services. Adjusters spend hours manually reviewing submissions, categorizing claims, and routing them to the right teams. ClaimsPilot AI reduces this to seconds — with consistent accuracy and full audit trails.

## What I Learned

- **Financial Domain** — First deep dive into insurance/fintech workflows and their unique challenges
- **Computer Vision for Documents** — Using LandingAI for intelligent document processing and evidence extraction
- **Real-Time Data Pipelines** — Building streaming pipelines with Pathway for live claims monitoring
- **End-to-End Automation** — Connecting intake, triage, routing, and visibility into a seamless workflow

## Looking Back

Hackathon #32! Breaking into the financial domain was exciting — the problems are complex, the stakes are real, and the impact of automation is massive. Coming from my experience at Guidewire in the insurance space, I had domain knowledge that gave our solution a practical edge. ClaimsPilot AI showed that AI-driven claims processing isn't a future concept — it's ready for production today.
