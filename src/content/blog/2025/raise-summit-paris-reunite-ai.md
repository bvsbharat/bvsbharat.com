We're the **2nd Runner-Up** at the World's Largest AI Hackathon — RAISE Your Hack!

Still buzzing from the incredible energy at the **Carrousel du Louvre** in Paris and beyond — where **6,700+ hackers** joined forces to shape the future of AI. From sleepless nights to our product demo standing tall beside the Mona Lisa — this was no ordinary weekend.

## What We Built

**Reunite.ai** — an AI-powered missing person identification and recovery system. The platform uses advanced AI to match missing person reports with sightings, leveraging facial recognition, geospatial analysis, and community-sourced data to help reunite families.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Matching** — Advanced facial recognition and similarity algorithms to match missing person reports with new sightings
- **Community-Sourced Data** — Crowdsourced sighting reports from the community to expand search coverage
- **Geospatial Analysis** — Location-based matching and pattern detection across reported sightings
- **Real-Time Alerts** — Instant notifications when potential matches are identified

## The RAISE Summit Experience

The RAISE Summit brought together the global AI community at one of the world's most iconic venues — the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris. With 6,700+ participants, it was the world's largest AI hackathon. The event was organized by lablab.ai and Prosus Ventures, creating an unforgettable atmosphere of innovation and collaboration.

48 hours of non-stop creativity and code. The scale of the event was something else — teams from around the world, diverse backgrounds, all united by a shared passion for building with AI.

## Why It Matters

Missing persons cases are a global challenge. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual processes and limited databases. Reunite.ai demonstrated how AI can dramatically accelerate the identification and recovery process — turning hours of manual searching into seconds of intelligent matching.

## What I Learned

- **Building for Social Impact** — How AI can tackle real humanitarian challenges
- **Scaling Under Pressure** — Building a production-ready demo in 48 hours with a global team
- **Computer Vision at Scale** — Working with facial recognition and image matching systems
- **International Collaboration** — Working alongside hackers from dozens of countries

## Looking Back

Hack win #25. This hackathon was special — not just for the result, but for the mission. Building technology that could help reunite families gave the 48-hour sprint a purpose beyond the competition. And doing it beside the Mona Lisa? That's a story for the grandkids.

Huge thanks to lablab.ai, Prosus Ventures, and all the organizers for an unforgettable experience, and to our team for pushing through 48 hours of non-stop creativity and code.
