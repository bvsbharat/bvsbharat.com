Thrilled to share that I won the Entrepreneurs First x Soma Capital Hackathon!

This hackathon focused on building practical voice tools to streamline front-office work in industries like finance, law, and logistics.

I showcased how a voice agent can redefine the e-shopping experience — driving the entire journey from discovery to checkout, and delivering an end-to-end solution that makes shopping more natural, intuitive, and effortless.

## Biggest Takeaways

- The power of voice AI in creating seamless user experiences
- How hackathons push you to move fast, validate ideas, and turn concepts into working solutions
- The importance of rethinking everyday workflows with fresh eyes

## Acknowledgments

On to the next challenge!
