Hackathon winning isn't just about building fast — it's about learning how to think, plan, and win as a team under pressure.

This weekend at the **SVAI Hub Grand Opening Hackathon**, our team came together with one goal: to create something bold in 8 hours.

We built **SnowOptima.ai** — an ad generator agent powered by Snowflake Cortex analytics and AI that helps brands run smarter, more optimised campaigns.

**Result? 1st Place Winner!**

## The Problem

Advertisers struggle to optimize campaigns across budgets, targeting, creatives, and engagement. Traditional tools fail to unify campaign data, product info, and customer feedback, leaving fragmented insights and missed ROI opportunities.

## What We Built

**Snow Optima AI** is an industry-agnostic platform that unifies structured and unstructured data to tackle ad optimization.

### Architecture

Built with **Python & Fast MCP** for agent orchestration and **Snowflake Cortex** services:

- **Cortex Analyst** — Processes structured campaign data
- **Cortex Search** — Ingests PDFs and reviews
- **Cortex Agents** — Integrates insights into a unified strategy

### Key Features

- **NLP Sentiment Extraction** — Extracts sentiment and relevance from customer feedback
- **Multimodal AI Fusion** — Fuses campaign, product, and customer signals into unified insights
- **Interactive Dashboard** — Next.js dashboard delivering interactive campaign insights
- **Recommendation Engine** — Suggests budget shifts, keyword refinements, and creative adjustments
- **Automated Reporting** — Produces manager-ready summaries
- **Scalable Deployment** — Docker ensures scalable, reproducible deployment

Showcased with **Amazon Ads** data to demonstrate real-world applicability.

## Tech Stack

- **Snowflake** — Cortex Search, Cortex Analyst, Cortex Agents, Document AI, Adaptive Gen2 Warehouse
- **CrewAI** — Multi-agent orchestration
- **AWS** — Cloud infrastructure
- **Next.js** — Interactive frontend dashboard
- **Python** — Backend and agent logic
- **Fast MCP** — Agent orchestration protocol
- **Docker** — Containerized deployment

## The Real Win

But the real win wasn't just the trophy. It was:

- Learning how to **divide and conquer** a huge problem
- **Adapting fast** when things broke
- **Celebrating every victory** as a team

## The Team

Big shoutout to the team — Mayur Katariya, Deepak Yadlapalli, Uday Reddy Malgireddy — nothing beats that rush of solving, shipping, and winning together.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the organisers, judges, and sponsors — **Snowflake**, **Meta**, **AWS**, **CrewAI**, **WRITER**, **LandingAI**, **DeepLearning.AI**, **Glean**, and **Cerebral Valley** — for fueling such an inspiring hackathon.

I also had the opportunity to meet with exceptional individuals working on innovative AI applications — Tony Kipkemboi, Ankit Khare, Seshu Reddy, Ivanna Lorena Hernandez Santos, and Elsa Mayer.

## Looking Back

This hackathon reinforced a key lesson: the best teams don't just write code — they communicate, adapt, and ship under pressure. SnowOptima.ai proved that combining Snowflake's Cortex services with agentic AI creates a powerful platform for real-world advertising optimization.
