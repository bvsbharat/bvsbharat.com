Jumping into the hackathon was an absolutely exhilarating experience! The thrill of crafting cutting-edge AI applications with real-time voice and video technology was unmatched. And clinching the victory? It left me buzzing with energy and inspiration!

## What We Built

**Echoforge Studio** — transparent and customizable AI voice agents. A platform that gives users full control over how voice AI agents behave, respond, and interact in real-time.

## The Experience

This hackathon pushed the boundaries of what's possible with voice and video AI. Building with real-time streaming, voice synthesis, and agent orchestration in a single sprint was the kind of challenge that keeps you in the zone for hours.
