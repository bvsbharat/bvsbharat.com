Excited to share that our team walked away with **three incredible prizes** at the Llama Impact Hackathon hosted by AI at Meta and partners MindsDB, Solo, LlamaIndex, Together AI, AutogenAI, Snowflake, lablab.ai, The AI Alliance, and Restack in San Francisco!

This win is particularly special as we tackled the **"Navigating Public Services"** challenge — a problem that affects countless people trying to find essential info on public service websites.

## The Prizes

We secured:

1. **1st Prize** in the Llama Impact Challenge
2. **Best Use of MindsDB** Award
3. **Solo (On-Device LLM)** Award

This victory means so much, especially since my brother, Yeshvant Kumar Bhavnasi Venkat Satya, and I have been on this journey together, pushing through two previous hackathons as runners-up. But this third one? We nailed it! Not only is it our first big win, but it also represents the culmination of countless hours, late nights, and collaboration.

## Meet Llama Navigator

Our solution is **Llama Navigator** — a Chrome extension that acts like a GPS for public websites, helping users locate specific information without the endless scrolling and frustration.

Imagine being able to find exactly where to file your taxes on IRS.gov or book an appointment on the DMV site without any hassle. Llama Navigator guides you directly to the answers you need, making public services more accessible and user-friendly.

### How It Works

- **Smart Navigation**: Uses Llama 3.1 to understand user queries and navigate complex government websites
- **Chrome Extension**: Seamlessly integrates into the browser for instant access
- **On-Device Processing**: Runs locally using Solo's on-device LLM capabilities for privacy
- **MindsDB Integration**: Leverages MindsDB for intelligent data processing and query understanding

## What's Next

Thanks to Meta and all the organizers for putting together such an incredible event!
