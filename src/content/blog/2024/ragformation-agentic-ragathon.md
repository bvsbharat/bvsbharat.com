Excited to share our latest achievement — **RAGformation** snagged the **"Best Use of Box"** award at the Agentic RAG-A-THON!

## What is RAGformation?

RAGformation combines **Agentic AI**, NLP, and **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to demystify cloud complexities and accelerate innovation. With just a description (or even a sketch!) of a cloud service, our AI jumps in to:

- **Research** optimal cloud configurations
- **Design** architecture patterns
- **Diagram** visual flow diagrams
- **Calculate costs** using real pricing data

The platform provides detailed pricing, allows refinement based on feedback, and generates comprehensive PDF reports with confirmed configurations and costs.

## The Dream Team

Big shout-out to the dream team: Supriya Ramarao Prasanna, Rushi Chaudhari, Anthony Avendano, Christen Jacquottet, Kevin Q Tran, and myself! In under **48 hours**, without even knowing each other beforehand, this powerhouse crew brought RAGformation to life from scratch!

## Tech Stack

- **LlamaIndex** — Workflows and agents for orchestration
- **Pinecone** — Vector database for semantic search
- **Box** — Data storage and document management
- **LlamaCloud** — RAG infrastructure
- **Together.ai** — LLM inference
- **React** — Frontend
- **Python** — Backend

## How It Works

1. **Input**: User describes their cloud use case or uploads a sketch
2. **Research**: Agentic AI researches best cloud services and configurations
3. **Design**: Generates optimal architecture with visual diagrams
4. **Cost Analysis**: Calculates pricing across providers
5. **Report**: Produces comprehensive PDF with confirmed configurations
