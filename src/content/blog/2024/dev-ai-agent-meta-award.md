I'm excited to share that our project **Dev_AI_Agent** received both the **Best Use of Llama 3.1 Award** from Meta and placed as **Runner-Up** at the AI Agent Hackathon!

## What is Dev AI Agent?

Dev_AI_Agent is a groundbreaking coding assistant that operates as an intelligent agent on local machines, **automating up to 99% of the app development process**. It builds entire applications from scratch — components, pages, and APIs — while supporting various tech stacks like Next.js and Angular.

### Key Features

- **Full App Generation**: Takes a complex idea and transforms it into a fully functional app in minutes
- **Multi-Stack Support**: Works with Next.js, Angular, React, and more
- **Privacy-First**: Offers both local and deployed versions, ensuring full code security
- **On-Device Execution**: Optimized to run Llama 3.1 efficiently on M1 Macs with 32GB RAM
- **100x Speed**: Demonstrated building a complete note-taking app (Notex) in minutes vs. traditional development

## The Demo

During the RAG-A-THON event, we demonstrated how Dev AI Agent can take a complex idea like a note-taking application and transform it into a fully functional app in minutes — at **100x the speed** of traditional development.

## Awards

- **Best Use of Llama 3.1** — Awarded by Meta for optimal use of the Llama 3.1 model
- **Runner-Up** — AI Agent Hackathon 2024 by Lablab.ai

## Why It Matters

This project highlights the transformative power of AI in building and shipping products faster than ever. By running LLMs on-device, we maintain privacy while delivering incredible speed — making development faster, cost-effective, and highly customizable.

## Tech Stack

- **LLM**: Meta Llama 3.1 (on-device)
- **Hardware**: Optimized for Apple M1/M2 with 32GB RAM
- **Frameworks**: Next.js, Angular support
- **Architecture**: Local-first agent with cloud deployment option

This experience was a game-changer, and I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what AI can do in app development!
